# Organize-My-Files 📁🧹🐍

This script is designed to organize files in a specified directory based on their file extensions. It sorts files into subdirectories according to their extensions, making it easier to manage and locate files by type.

## 💡Intuition

When you run the script, it prompts you to enter a path to the directory containing the files you want to organize. The script then processes each file in the directory, creating subdirectories for each unique file extension and moving the files into their respective subdirectories.

For instance, if you have a directory with files like `file1.txt`, `file2.jpg`, and `file3.docx`, the script will create subdirectories named `txt`, `jpg`, and `docx`, respectively, and move the files into their respective subdirectories.

## ⚒️Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Enter the path of the directory you want to organize when prompted.
3. The script will create subdirectories for each unique file extension and move the files accordingly.

**Note**: This script is a basic organizer and might not cover all use cases. Use it with caution and consider backing up your files before running the script.
